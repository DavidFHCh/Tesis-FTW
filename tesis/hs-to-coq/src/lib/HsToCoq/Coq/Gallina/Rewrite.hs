Description : Rewrite rule enginge for the Gallina AST

Stability   : experimental

This module implements rewrite rules. So far, this is straight forward and
not very efficiently.

Efficiency of finding a rewrite rule (candidate) could be greatly improved by
 * sorting the rewrite rules into a map, based on the outermost functions.
 * implementing an actual trie
This can be relevant when the numer of rewrite rules increases.

Another improvemet would be to detect bad patterns (non-linear ones,
unsupported AST nodes) and report such errors upon parsing.
